# Small take-home project for new hires to show off their skills on.

Please fork this and make appropiate edits to display a chat between two "players".

What we hope to see:
- We expect the code to pass lint (yarn eslint ./src/*)
- We expect code to pass typescript (yarn tsc)
- We expect you to use styled-components

What we dont really care about:
- We *dont* expect extremely nice design (focus on code)

We hope this won't take too long (1-2 hours!).
